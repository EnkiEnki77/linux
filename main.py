# Shell, CLI, and Terminal often refer to the same thing, a program utilized for issuing text-based
# commands.
# Pedantically though the terminal is responsible just for drawing text on the screen and processing
# key strokes
# The program that actually runs commands in the terminal is the shell. Their job is to interpret commands
# typed into your terminal and execute them.

# shell's are often referred to as REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop)

# They read the command typed into your terminal
# Evaluate it, usually by running other programs on your computer
# Output the result to the terminal
# Prompt for another input.


# Its helpful to be able to see the commands youve typed in the past so you can easily re run them
# or copy paste them into a script.

# The command for seeing your command history is... history.


# You can clear your terminal screen using the clear command
