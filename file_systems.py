# All the data stored on your computer is organized into files and directories, which are organized
# into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.

# Directories are containers that hold files and other directories
# Files are dumps of raw binary data, they can represent anything, images, text, videos, etc.

# At the top of the file system is a single directory, called the root directory.

# When you open the terminal your working directory (the one youre currently in) will likely be your home
# directory.

# The pwd command prints the filepath to your working directory.

# A file path is a string that describes the location of a file or directory.

# /home/remdu
# / is the root directory, home is the name of a directory inside the root, /remdu is a directory inside
# /home, and is the working directory since its the last directory in the file path.


# The ls command lets you see the contents of your current working directory


# The cd command lets you go to a directory further down in the filesystem tree.
# cd .. lets you move back up a directory.


# You can pass an argument to ls to read the contents of child directories of your working directory:
# ls worldbanc
